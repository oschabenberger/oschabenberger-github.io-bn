abstract = {We are given a large database of customer transactions. Each transaction consists of items purchased by a customer in a visit. We present an efficient algorithm that generates all significant association rules between items in the database. The algorithm incorporates buffer management and novel estimation and pruning techniques. We also present results of applying this algorithm to sales data obtained from a large retailing company, which shows the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

 abstract = {In the analysis of data it is often assumed that observations y1, y2, ..., yn are independently normally distributed with constant variance and with expectations specified by a model linear in a set of parameters θ. In this paper we make the less restrictive assumption that such a normal, homoscedastic, linear model is appropriate after some suitable transformation has been applied to the y's. Inferences about the transformation and about the parameters of the linear model are made by computing the likelihood function and the relevant posterior distribution. The contributions of normality, homoscedasticity and additivity to the transformation are separated. The relation of the present methods to earlier procedures for finding transformations is discussed. The methods are illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {An approach to the construction of classifiers from imbalanced datasets is described. 
A dataset is imbalanced if the classification categories are not approximately equally represented. 
Often real-world data sets are predominately composed of "normal" examples with only a small percentage 
of "abnormal" or "interesting" examples. It is also the case that the cost of misclassifying an abnormal
(interesting) example as a normal example is often much higher than the cost of the reverse error. 
Under-sampling of the majority (normal) class has been proposed as a good means of increasing the 
sensitivity of a classifier to the minority class. This paper shows that a combination of our method of 
oversampling the minority (abnormal)class and under-sampling the majority (normal) class can achieve better 
classifier performance (in ROC space) than only under-sampling the majority class. 
This paper also shows that a combination of our method of over-sampling the minority class and 
under-sampling the majority class can achieve better classifier performance (in ROC space) than 
varying the loss ratios in Ripper or class priors in Naive Bayes. Our method of over-sampling the minority 
class involves creating synthetic minority class examples. Experiments are performed using C4.5, Ripper and a Naive Bayes 
classifier. The method is evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic 
curve (AUC) and the ROC convex hull strategy.},

abstract = {Machine learning offers a fantastically powerful toolkit for building useful complex prediction systems quickly. This paper argues it is dangerous to think of these quick wins as coming for free. Using the software engineering framework of technical debt, we find it is common to incur massive ongoing maintenance costs in real-world ML systems. We explore several ML-specific risk factors to account for in system design. These include boundary erosion, entanglement, hidden feedback loops, undeclared consumers, data dependencies, configuration issues, changes in the external world, and a variety of system-level anti-patterns.},

abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.},
