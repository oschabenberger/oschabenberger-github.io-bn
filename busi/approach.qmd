# Approach and Methodology {#sec-busi-approach}

## General Approach

Because the Business Understanding phase is pivotal to a project's ultimate success, it needs to be **inclusive**, **iterative**, and have **specific deliverables** that must be met to be effective.

### Inclusive Discovery

Here is a list of typical participants in the Business Understanding phase for a large-scale project. These are the people who will be directly affected by the project or have insights that will be used to inform the requirements and/or project design. Usually, there will be a multi-day kickoff to perform the Business Understanding discovery with the entire group present. This is important to ensure that business problem framing and solution framing are aligned and that roadblocks are identified quickly and addressed inline. While this appears to be a large number of participants, some of the roles outlined here can be filled by a single person. Many projects have ultimately been derailed because key participants were not included in the Business Understanding meetings, leading to unidentified roadblocks or business objectives.

#### Strategic stakeholders

Generally, executives at the SVP level or higher focus on the strategic objectives of the company. In some organizations, Directors also fill this role. Higher-level executives want to ensure that projects align with strategic objectives.

-   C-level executives (including CEO, CFO, etc.)
-   Executive Vice Presidents (EVP-level) executives
-   Senior Vice Presidents (SVP-level) executives
-   Directors (in some organizations)

#### Tactical stakeholders

-   Managers
-   Team members

Tactical stakeholders are the process owners. They perform the "day-to-day" process work. Often, tactical stakeholders are the teams that will use the data science solutions to bring about change. They ensure continuity with current business processes and provide valuable feedback on how the data science-driven solution should work.

#### Data subject matter experts

-   Business analysts
-   Data engineers

Data subject matter experts understand the structure, semantic meaning, and business importance of data in corporate data stores. They identify potential issues with data availability, quality, privacy, and other concerns.

#### Information technology (IT)

-   Enterprise architects
-   Software developers

Enterprise architects understand the topology of hardware infrastructure and design of software systems and how they integrate to deliver business solutions. They ensure that the data science solution follows architectural and security standards. Software developers create the necessary middleware (software that contains business logic) and user interface elements of the data science solution.

#### Data science team

-   Data scientists
-   Business analysts

Data scientists build predictive and prescriptive models that drive both tactical and strategic decisions. Business analysts deliver business intelligence reporting, dashboarding of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and visualizations.


### Iterative Refinement

The CRISP-DM process was developed with iterative learning and continuous improvement in mind. The Business Understanding phase is iterative, meaning that it starts with an initial problem definition and evolves into a more refined problem and solution definition. It can be helpful to review the problem definition at each stage of the process to ensure business stakeholders remain aligned with your understanding of the opportunities and solutions. It is common for business stakeholders' priorities to change as the project progresses. Multi-month (or even multi-year) projects can fail if priorities change, processes evolve, or new business problems are identified and the design is not updated accordingly.


### Specific Deliverables: Business Understanding Document

The Business Understanding document serves as the foundational blueprint for any data science project, providing a comprehensive framework that connects business objectives with technical implementation. Its primary purpose is to ensure all stakeholders have a clear, shared understanding of what the project aims to achieve, how it will be executed, and how success will be measured. This document acts as both a strategic compass and an operational roadmap. Starting with strategic alignment and stakeholder analysis, it establishes the "why" and "who" of the project. The requirements documentation and feasibility assessment sections then build upon this foundation to define the "what" and "how possible." The business process impact analysis ensures we understand the organizational changes needed, while the KPIs and success criteria establish how we'll measure progress and success. Finally, the project plan transforms all these insights into actionable steps. Most importantly, this document serves as a single source of truth that teams can reference throughout the project lifecycle to maintain alignment, resolve disputes, and make informed decisions. It should be treated as a living document that can be updated as new information emerges or business conditions change while still maintaining its core purpose of keeping the project aligned with business objectives.

#### Overview of strategic alignment

Strategic alignment focuses on ensuring the data mining initiative directly supports business objectives and strategy. This includes documenting current business challenges, identifying key stakeholders and their needs, and understanding how the project's outcomes will drive business value. It also involves mapping organizational capabilities, constraints, and assumptions that could impact project success.

#### Stakeholder analysis

A detailed mapping of:

-   Key stakeholders and their roles
-   Communication requirements and preferences
-   Decision-making authority levels
-   Expected involvement and responsibilities
-   Impact assessment for each stakeholder group

#### Requirements documentation

A comprehensive documentation of both functional and technical requirements, including:

-   Data requirements and sources
-   System integration needs
-   Security and compliance requirements
-   Stakeholder access and reporting needs
-   Performance and scalability requirements
-   Data governance and privacy considerations

#### Feasibility assessment

A thorough analysis that evaluates:

-   Technical feasibility (available tools, data, expertise)
-   Economic feasibility (ROI analysis, cost-benefit breakdown)
-   Operational feasibility (organizational readiness)
-   Legal and ethical considerations
-   Data availability and quality assessment
-   Resource availability and constraints

#### Business process impact analysis

Documentation of how the data mining project will affect:

-   Current business processes
-   Workflow changes needed
-   Training requirements
-   System integrations
-   Organizational change management needs
-   Dependencies on other systems or processes

#### KPI and metrics

The KPI and metrics deliverable establishes quantifiable measures that will be used to track project progress and success. This includes identifying both business KPIs (like revenue growth, customer retention, or cost reduction) and technical KPIs (model accuracy, precision, recall). Each metric should have a clear baseline, target value, and measurement methodology. The document should also explain how these metrics connect to broader business objectives.

#### Success criteria

Success criteria define the specific thresholds and conditions that must be met for the project to be considered successful. This deliverable includes both business and technical success criteria:

-   Business criteria might specify required improvements in operational efficiency, revenue targets, or cost savings
-   Technical criteria outline required model performance levels, data quality standards, and system performance requirements

The document should also detail how success will be measured and validated throughout the project lifecycle.

#### Project plan

The project plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for executing the data science initiative. It includes:

-   Detailed timeline with major milestones and dependencies
-   Resource requirements (technical, human, and infrastructure)
-   Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
-   Budget allocation and tracking mechanisms
-   Communication plan for stakeholders
-   Quality assurance approach and checkpoints
-   Change management strategy
-   Contingency plans

The plan should be realistic, accounting for available resources and organizational constraints while maintaining alignment with business objectives.
